"""
Synchronous code execution service interface.

Defines the contract for multi-language code interpretation with context management,
session persistence, and real-time execution capabilities (SSE streaming), **in blocking form**.

This is the sync counterpart of :mod:`code_interpreter.services.code`.

class CodesSync(Protocol):
    """
    Code execution service for multi-language code interpretation (sync).

    This service provides advanced code execution capabilities with context management,
    session persistence, and multi-language support.

    Supported Languages (typical):
        - Python
        - JavaScript / TypeScript
        - Bash
        - Java
        - Kotlin (depending on server image)

    Key Features:
        - Execution Contexts: Isolated environments with persistent state
        - Variable Persistence: Variables and imports persist across executions in a context
        - Real-time Interruption: Stop long-running code execution safely
        - Output Streaming: Real-time stdout/stderr via SSE

    Notes:
        - All methods are **blocking** and executed in the current thread.
        - For non-blocking usage, prefer the async :class:`code_interpreter.services.code.Codes`.

        Create a new execution context for code interpretation (blocking).

        An execution context maintains state (variables/imports/working directory) across
        multiple code executions, enabling interactive sessions.

            language: The programming language for this context (e.g., "python", "typescript").

        Returns:
            A new CodeContextSync.

            SandboxException: If the language is not supported or context creation fails.

        Execute code within the specified context (blocking).

        This method runs the provided code string in the language interpreter, capturing output,
        errors, and execution metadata. Execution happens within the context's environment,
        preserving variable state and working directory.

        Execution behavior:
            - Blocking: The call does not return until the stream finishes.
            - Stateful: Variables and imports persist in the context.
            - Streaming: Output is processed incrementally as SSE events arrive.
            - Interruptible: Can be stopped using :meth:`interrupt`.

        Args:
            code: Source code to execute.
            context: Execution context (language + optional id). If None, a temporary Python context is used.
            handlers: Optional streaming handlers for stdout/stderr/events.

        Returns:
            Execution with stdout/stderr/events and execution metadata.
